# Certifications: Learning with love.
This rep has my professional ceritifications. 
I started off as a generic Electronics and Communications engineer and then specialized in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. Through my academic years, I have been priviledged to learn and create enough to give me the exposure and love to do more. 
Everything displayed here is only done so to share my willingness to contribute more in the future, and inspire through my love for learning.
